# CUDA C Projects
In this repository, you can find different projects that present parallel processing projects. The codes are written in CUDA C language, since the GPU that these codes were tested on was NVIDIA GEFORCE 960M.

## Projects
- [Adding two Matrix Vectors](https://github.com/kiazamiri/CUDA-C-Projects/blob/master/Vector%20Add/Vector_Add.c)
- [Hello World from GPU](https://github.com/kiazamiri/CUDA-C-Projects/blob/master/Hello_World/Hello_World.c)
- [The Multiplication of two Matrix with GPU](https://github.com/kiazamiri/CUDA-C-Projects/blob/master/Matrix_Multiplication/Matrix_Multiplication.c)
